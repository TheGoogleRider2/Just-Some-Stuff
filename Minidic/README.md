# MiniDic

It's a simple dice game that allows you to bet on the outcome of two dice, it supposed to be a version of the [Mini-Dice](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Dice) game from the olden times, but to be honest I don't really understand the game and I just wrote the most terrible, inefficient, ugly looking code with so many if-else statements text game ever. The game is not even fun, it's just luck, it's stupidly unfair.

anyways I had to make it for school so yeah ~_~]
